# Informed definition for @precise constraint
# Used for calibration and understanding expected behavior
version: "1.0"

constraint:
  name: precise
  tag: "@precise"
  description: "Be specific and exact, avoid vague language"

expected_behavior:
  primary_effects:
    - "Use specific numbers, dates, names when relevant"
    - "Avoid hedging language (maybe, possibly, might)"
    - "Make definite claims where warranted"
    - "Qualify only when genuinely uncertain"
    - "Prefer concrete over abstract"

  trait_expectations:
    precision:
      direction: increase
      magnitude: high
      notes: "Primary target trait - should see significant increase"
    reasoning_depth:
      direction: increase
      magnitude: slight
      notes: "Precision often requires explanation"
    conciseness:
      direction: neutral
      magnitude: none
      notes: "Precision is orthogonal to length"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Excessive hedging (approximately, roughly, around)"
    - "Vague quantifiers (some, many, few)"
    - "Non-committal language when facts are known"
    - "Abstract statements when specifics exist"
